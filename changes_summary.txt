Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Detailed Summary of Data Cleaning Steps:

1. Removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancy and ensure that each entry in the dataset represents a unique customer case.

2. Handled missing numeric values by imputing the median of the respective columns. This approach preserves the overall distribution of the data without being overly influenced by outliers.

3. Addressed missing categorical values by filling them with the mode (most frequent category), ensuring consistency and preventing issues during encoding or analysis.

4. Cleaned and standardized all text-based fields by trimming unnecessary whitespace and converting the text to lowercase. This step helps prevent mismatched values caused by inconsistent formatting (e.g., " Married" vs. "married").

5. Converted date-related columns into proper datetime format, enabling accurate time-series analysis, customer tenure calculation, and future feature engineering.

6. Renamed columns using a consistent lowercase and underscore-separated format. This improves readability, eliminates formatting irregularities, and ensures compatibility with Python coding standards during analysis and modeling.

Overall, the dataset has been thoroughly cleaned, standardized, and prepared for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows.
